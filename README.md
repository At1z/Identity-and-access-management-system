## Project Overview  
The goal of this project was to create a highly secure Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. To achieve this, we implemented various security measures, including:  

- **JWT Tokens** – for secure authentication and authorization.  
- **Amazon KMS** – to manage encryption keys securely.  
- **Regular Expressions** – for input validation and security enforcement.  
- **HTTPS Protocol** – ensuring encrypted communication between the client and server.  
- **Database Hashing** – securing sensitive data, such as user passwords.  
- **Account Blocking Mechanism** – protecting against brute-force attacks and suspicious activities.
